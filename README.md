# Screen-Recorder-Python

Hey guys, here's my screen recorder programes with Python.
Actually only one of them is the actual screen recorder another ons only shows you your screen back when it's triggered.
The actual screen recorder (ie 'screenRecorder.py'), when triggered first shows you yours screen back and starts to record and keeps recording untill you press the key 's' (you can change it though), and once the key's' is pressed it stops and saves the file in the same directory where the screen recorder programme is located (again you can change it), and instead of overwritting the files once created what it does is creates another file with the same first name but a random middlle name and saves the new files.
